Creating a Slideshow for Images!

<!-- The slideshow will be shown in the div below, by changing the "src" of the img element: -->
<div id="slideshowContainer">
  <img src="" alt="" id="slideshow">
</div>

CSS - Copy and paste this section to your CSS:

/* The number below sets the height of your images. */
#slideshow {
  height: 300px;
}

/* You can change the style of the slideshow container to customize it. */
#slideshowContainer {
  background: #131313;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}

JavaScript - Copy and paste this section to your JS:

// Select the elements we are interacting with. In this case the "#slideshow".
let slideshow = document.querySelector("#slideshow");

// You can change repeatTime to a larger number to slow down the slideshow. This is the time in miliseconds to change from one image to the next, so mine is 1000ms.
let repeatTime = 1000;
let imageNumber = 0;

// Place your images in the list below, the filenames or urls should be in quotes ("") and seperated by commas (,)
let images = ["", "", ""];

// Changing the pictures is a setInterval loop (a sequence of instructions that repeats over time) for each picture.
setInterval(function() {
  // These are the instructions that repeat.
  let currentImage = images[imageNumber];
  slideshow.src = currentImage;

  // To display the next image we increase the imageNumber by 1 each time.
  imageNumber = imageNumber + 1;
  
  // If the image number becomes to high we will run out of pictures, so the code below resets us back to the first (0th) image when this happens.
  if (imageNumber == images.length) {
    imageNumber = 0;
  }
}, repeatTime)
